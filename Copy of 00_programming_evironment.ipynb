Doing this repeatedly using a mouse (or trackpad) can be tedious. But there's a better way: keyboard shortcuts!\n","\n","Professional developers minimize their use of the mouse (trackpad) as much as possible. Keyboard navigation is much more predictable and precise, which allows us to express our ideas in code much more fluidly, and to make edits to existing code faster, and with more confidence. While we don't need to use keyboard shortcuts exclusively yet &mdash; even professional developers will still use the mouse occasionally &mdash; it's a good idea to start getting used to them as soon as possible. The more we use them, the more habitual they become.\n","\n","Let's consider the code block below while reading about some simple shortcuts we can use in Colab. Be sure to try them out as we read about each shortcut!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bWLO397ra30H","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":68},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1598051124934,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":404,"user":{"displayName":"","photoUrl":"","userId":""}},"outputId":"c8318cb9-b05e-4f26-b95c-8836ab1f0035"},"source":["# This line is a comment.

This is usually just written as `⌘/` or `⌘+/`. If you are on a line which is already a comment, `⌘/` will remove the comment mark.
